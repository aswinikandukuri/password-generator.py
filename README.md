🔐 Random Password Generator – Python Project
🎓 Infosys Internship Project
📌 Project Overview

The Random Password Generator is a Python-based command-line application that generates strong and secure passwords based on user preferences.
This project was developed as part of my Infosys Internship, demonstrating core Python programming skills, user input handling, and randomization techniques.
The application allows users to:
Choose password length
Include or exclude letters
Include or exclude numbers
Include or exclude special symbols
The system then generates a secure random password based on the selected options.

🚀 Features
🔢 Custom password length selection
🔤 Option to include letters (A–Z, a–z)
🔢 Option to include numbers (0–9)
🔣 Option to include special characters (!, @, #, etc.)
⚡ Instant password generation
🖥️ Simple and user-friendly command-line interface

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Built-in Python Libraries:
random – for generating random characters
string – for accessing character sets (letters, digits, symbols)
No external libraries required ✅

💻 How to Run the Project
Step 1: Install Python
Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

Check version:
python --version

Step 2: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

Step 3: Navigate to Project Folder
cd your-repository-name

Step 4: Run the Program
python password_generator.py
